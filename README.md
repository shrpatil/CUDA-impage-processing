Fabric defect detection using CUDA parallel processing

Fabric defect detection algorithms lack the real-time performance required in real applications because of their demanding computation. By using GPU, we are improving the processing speed of hardware system. This project will reduces the manual work required for testing the fabric defects. The GPU signicantly speeds up computation, especially achieving approximately av- erage thirty times than on the CPU.Our proposed work focuses on ecient real time implementation of an textile fabric defect detection algorithm called ITT using the concept of iterative tensor tracking on graphics processing unit(GPU).The algorithm adopts a new local image descriptor, spatial histograms of oriented gradients(S-HOG). To speedup the calculation required, ITT is implemented on the GPU using the Compute Unied Device Architecture programming model.
